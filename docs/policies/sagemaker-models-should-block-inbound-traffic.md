# AWS SageMaker models should block inbound traffic

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon SageMaker AI hosted model blocks inbound network traffic. The control fails if the EnableNetworkIsolation parameter for the hosted model is set to False.

SageMaker AI training and deployed inference containers are internet-enabled by default. If you don't want SageMaker AI to provide external network access to your training or inference containers, you can enable network isolation. If you enable network isolation, the containers can't make any outbound network calls, even to other AWS services. Additionally, no AWS credentials are made available to the container runtime environment. Enabling network isolation helps prevent unintended access to your SageMaker AI resources from the internet.

This rule is covered by the [sagemaker-models-should-block-inbound-traffic](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/sagemaker/sagemaker-models-should-block-inbound-traffic.sentinel) policy.
