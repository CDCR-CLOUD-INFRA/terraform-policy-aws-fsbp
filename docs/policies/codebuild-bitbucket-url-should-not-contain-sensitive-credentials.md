# CodeBuild Bitbucket source repository URLs should not contain sensitive credentials

## Description

This control checks whether an AWS CodeBuild project Bitbucket source repository URL contains personal access tokens or a user name and password. The control fails if the Bitbucket source repository URL contains personal access tokens or a user name and password.

Sign-in credentials shouldn't be stored or transmitted in clear text or appear in the source repository URL. Instead of personal access tokens or sign-in credentials, you should access your source provider in CodeBuild, and change your source repository URL to contain only the path to the Bitbucket repository location. Using personal access tokens or sign-in credentials could result in unintended data exposure or unauthorized access.

This rule is covered by the [codebuild-bitbucket-url-should-not-contain-sensitive-credentials](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/codebuild/codebuild-bitbucket-url-should-not-contain-sensitive-credentials.sentinel) policy.
