# AWS AppSync should have field-level logging enabled

| Provider            |      Category     |

## Description

This control checks whether an AWS AppSync API has field-level logging turned on. The control fails if the field resolver log level is set to None. Unless you provide custom parameter values to indicate that a specific log type should be enabled, Security Hub produces a passed finding if the field resolver log level is either ERROR or ALL.

This rule is covered by the [appsync-field-level-logging-should-be-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/appsync/appsync-field-level-logging-should-be-enabled.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash

        Pass - appsync-field-level-logging-should-be-enabled.sentinel

        attribute "log_config" with "field_log_level" set to "ERROR" or "ALL".

        Print messages:

        → → Overall Result: true
