## Description

This control checks whether RSA certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager use a key length of at least 2,048 bits. The control fails if the key length is smaller than 2,048 bits.

The strength of encryption directly correlates with key size. We recommend key lengths of at least 2,048 bits to protect your AWS resources as computing power becomes less expensive and servers become more advanced.

This rule is covered by the [acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/acm/acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
        Pass - acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048.sentinel

        Description:
        This policy requires resources of type `aws_acm_certificate` with rsa key
        algorithm should have atleast 2048 bits key length.

        Print messages:

        → → Overall Result: true

        This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048.

        ✓ Found 0 resource violations

        acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048.sentinel:60:1 - Rule "main"
        Value:
            true
```

## Policy Results (Fail)

```bash
trace:
        Fail - acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048.sentinel

        Description:
        This policy requires resources of type `aws_acm_certificate` with rsa key
        algorithm should have atleast 2048 bits key length.

        Print messages:

        → → Overall Result: false

        This result means that not all resources passed the policy check and the protected behavior is not allowed for the policy acm-rsa-certificate-key-length-atleast-2048.
