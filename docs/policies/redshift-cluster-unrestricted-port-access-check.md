# This policy requires resources of type aws_security_group aws_security_group_rule and aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule Redshift Parameter Group set to true to block ingress traffic from unknown sources to resources of type aws_redshift_cluster

## Description

This control checks whether a security group associated with an Amazon Redshift cluster has ingress rules that permit access to the cluster port from the internet (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). The control fails if the security group ingress rules permit access to the cluster port from the internet.

Permitting unrestricted inbound access to the Redshift cluster port (IP address with a /0 suffix) can result in unauthorized access or security incidents. We recommend applying the principal of least privilege access when creating security groups and configuring inbound rules.

This rule is covered by the [redshift-cluster-unrestricted-port-access-check](../../policies/redshift-cluster-unrestricted-port-access-check.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
      Pass - redshift-cluster-unrestricted-port-access-check.sentinel

      Description:
        This policy requires resources of type `aws_security_group`,
        `aws_security_group_rule` and `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule`
        to block ingress traffic from unknown sources to resources of type
        aws_redshift_cluster

      Print messages:

      → → Overall Result: true

      This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy redshift-cluster-unrestricted-port-access-check.
